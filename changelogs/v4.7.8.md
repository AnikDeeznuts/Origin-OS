# New Stuff

terminal "get access camera"

terminal "get access microphone"

sets the osl data variable to "Granted" or "Denied"

terminal "get windowxy"

sets the osl data variable to an array of window positions

"//" allows for a floor division

`variable %= value` <- allows for you to run modulus easier

`.sign` returns "+" or "-" based on if th enumber is positive or negative

`"hello" in "hello how are you"` <- the "in" command allows for you to check if a value is contained in another value

? operator:

`true ? "hello" "goodbye"` <- because the input is "true" this whole syntax is replaced with "hello"

Delete account command added (no server side support yet)

New set key functions:

hello."wow" = data

hello.["wow"] = data

else if function in osl

# Optimisations
