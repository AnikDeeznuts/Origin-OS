## Defining Custom Commands:

- **def "name" "input1,input2,input3,input4"**:
   - This command opens a define command block, allowing you to create custom commands that can be reused in your main script.
   - `"name"` is the name of the custom command.
   - `"input1,input2,input3,input4"` represents the input parameters that the custom command can accept.

- **endef**:
   - This command closes the current define command block, indicating the end of the custom command definition.

## Creating Custom Events:

- **Event "condition"**:
   - This command opens an event command block.
   - When the specified condition is met, anything inside the current event command block will be executed.
   - `"condition"` represents the condition or trigger for the event to occur.

- **Endevent**:
   - This command closes the current event command block, indicating the end of the event definition.

These custom commands and events provide a way to modularize your script and make it more organized and readable. You can define reusable commands and trigger specific actions based on conditions defined within events. This modular approach can simplify scripting and make it easier to maintain and extend your code.
