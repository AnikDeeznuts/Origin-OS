# MAJOR

HTTP Support for osl!

You can now send full http commands in osl

Documentation: https://github.com/Mistium/Origin-OS/wiki/OSL-%E2%80%90-Http



# New Stuff

Quick Settings redesign and now automatically uploads your files every now and then to stop you losing all your progress from a crash. You can also click the sync button on it to manually upload.

Network requests now send the version of origin you are using to the server and other users

Empty bin now functions as expected

You can shift while right clicking to show hidden functions on the right click menu for system files

.timestamp("convert-relative") osl command to convert a unicode timestamp to relative time

network "getsync" "url" - this osl command will wait until it receives back a response before continuing to the next part of the script

pointer lock functions - documentation here: https://github.com/Mistium/Origin-OS/wiki/Mouse-Cursor

Else statements now function correctly

if condition "code1" else "code2" - now supported

interpolation and fps limit terminal commands



# Optimisations

Variables system uses binary search, allowing for improved get speeds

speed increase for a few highly used osl methods

run command is now faster

the icon renderer now uses a faster splitting function



# Fixes and Changes

Apps can no-longer edit their own permissions files with the file command or th esave command

Applications will only store a permissions file and app data if the application actually needs them. (this prevents mass amounts of empty files using your storage space)
