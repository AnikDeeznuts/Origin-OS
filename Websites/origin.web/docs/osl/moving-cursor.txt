goto x y
: This command moves the cursor to the specified x and y coordinates on the screen.

change_x x
: This command changes the x coordinate of the cursor to the specified value.

change_y y
: This command changes the y coordinate of the cursor to the specified value.

change x y
: This command changes both the x and y coordinates of the cursor to the specified values.

---

loc a b c d
: This command moves the cursor relative to the current frame's dimensions. The parameters a, b, c, and d are used to calculate the new cursor position.
The loc command is equivalent to the following sequence of commands:

(

goto frame_width * -1 / a frame_height / b
: This command moves the cursor to a position relative to the frame's dimensions. The x coordinate is calculated as the negative of the frame's width divided by a, and the y coordinate is calculated as the frame's height divided by b.
 
change c d
: This command then changes the cursor's position by c in the x direction and d in the y direction.

)

In summary, the loc command provides a way to move the cursor relative to the current frame's dimensions, which can be useful when dealing with different screen sizes or resolutions.
